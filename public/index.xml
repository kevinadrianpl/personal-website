      <description>I own, maintain and secure a small Minecraft server that operates under the name Dxrery Networks and is a Towny server hosted in South Africa with custom mod-like features and time-based ranks in-game.&#xA;The features of the game server contain custom jobs, a questing system, a battlepass, player-based shops, a claiming system based on creating a town and a community within that town, and much more. It currently runs PaperMC which is based on Spigot, designed to greatly improve performance and offer more advanced features and API.</description>

      <description>Who am I? I&amp;rsquo;m Kevin from South Africa and I make things on the internet and occasionally off of it. I&amp;rsquo;m an experienced System Administrator and cybersecurity professional and I have a passion for all things security, learning more technical skills each day.&#xA;I sometimes play video games, work on different technical projects to enhance my skills and I often travel in my spare time.&#xA;I believe that deeply understanding the underlying systems you use (browsers, operating systems, the kernel, network layers, databases, HTTP, or whatever else that you may be running in your business, workplace or personal life) is essential if you want to do technically innovative work and to be able to solve real world problems.</description>
