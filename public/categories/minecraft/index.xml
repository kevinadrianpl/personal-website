      <description>I own, maintain and secure a small Minecraft server that operates under the name Dxrery Networks and is a Towny server hosted in South Africa with custom mod-like features and time-based ranks in-game.&#xA;The features of the game server contain custom jobs, a questing system, a battlepass, player-based shops, a claiming system based on creating a town and a community within that town, and much more. It currently runs PaperMC which is based on Spigot, designed to greatly improve performance and offer more advanced features and API.</description>
