  <summary>Personal Portfolio</summary>
  
This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my resume and my devlog.
  
  - This is a static site using a theme called '[Risotto](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto)', a minimalist, responsive hugo theme inspired by terminal ricing aesthetics. It is hosted through Github Pages and Netlify, and can be accessed at https://kevinadrian.dev/

  <summary>Open Source HTML Website</summary>
  
This is a simple 4-page website made as an example for a tattoo parlour that can be used as a template for basically any website. This was done as practice and contains basic code and images. The code for this project is freely available for use by anyone. Although it is very basic, it was one of my first HTML websites done to practice <font color="red">HTML, CSS and a bit of Tailwind</font>.

  - The template is available on my [Github](https://github.com/kevinadrianpl/html-website).

  <summary>Game Server Website</summary>
  
A small and very basic static website [template](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/nextjs-mdx-blog-theme) built with Next.js, MDX, and Tailwind CSS.

The main purpose of the website is to host my own written tutorials for the in-game server to help new players. It also lists the voting websites that players use for in-game rewards which also helps the server reach more players. At its peak, it has reached number 1 in South Africa, top 300 Towny servers in the world, and top 1000 servers in general. 
  
  - This is a basic project but very helpful to those that use the game server.

  <summary>Game Server Host</summary>
  
I own, maintain and secure a small gaming server that runs Minecraft: Java Edition and is a Towny creation server hosted in South Africa with custom mod-like features and free time-based ranks in-game. 

The features of the game server contain custom player jobs, a questing system, a free battlepass, player and server shops, a claiming system based on creating a town and a community within that town, the mod-like plugin Slimefun, and much more. It currently runs [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads/paper) which is a fork of Spigot, designed to greatly improve performance and offer more advanced features and API. 

Many of the Java based plugins that run on the server are open source while many others are premium plugins from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/). A few of these plugins I have coded myself using Java and are only available on this server, *for now*. 

This server was started in 2019 and has been online ever since, with an average daily user rate of 10 to 15 players, with the peak going up to over 100 players. 

This project is on-going indefinitely and most likely will not shut down any time soon since it is a used on a regular basis by South African players because there are not many other African based servers available. This helps the community with lower bandwidth that still want to play online with low ping.
  
  - If you are interested, it can be connected to via the IP <font color="red">play.dxrery.cyou</font>.

  - I have a community [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ubx7Tvu/) server if there are questions based on the server.

  <summary>All Steel Production</summary>
  
This is a website that I designed for a small/medium steel fabrication company and I currently maintain the website including security and changing/adding content to the website when requested by the company on a contract basis, done remotely. 
  
  - This is the website, [All Steel Production](https://www.aspkzn.co.za/). 

  - Currently it is built with Wordpress but I am in the process of a complete overhaul of this for security reasons.
