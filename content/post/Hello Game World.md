So why game development as a side project?
<!-- more -->

## Technical Skill Enhancement

As an enthusiast of both tech and gaming, I've decided to start my adventure in game development as a side project during my free time. This aims to not only improve my technical skills such as coding and design but also a bit of fun since I have always enjoyed gaming.

- Programming Proficiency
Game development involves coding in various languages so enhancing my proficiency in programming specifics such as object-oriented programming (OOP), scripting languages like Python or C#, and game-specific languages such as GML (GameMaker Language) will definitely benefit me professionally.

- Problem-Solving Abilities
Developing a game introduces complex challenges. From optimizing performance to implementing intricate game mechanics, it fosters problem-solving skills and the ability to tackle technical hurdles creatively.

- Understanding System Architecture
Creating a game necessitates understanding system architecture, memory management, and performance optimization to ensure a seamless gaming experience across different platforms and devices. Even the most simple game can require you to figure out thousands of intricate details.

- Visual and Audio Design
Working on game assets, including graphics, animations, and audio components, allows me to explore the creative aspects of design. This involves learning tools like Adobe Photoshop, Blender for 3D modeling, and sound editing software for immersive audio experiences.

- Version Control and Collaboration
Utilizing version control systems like Git for code management and collaborating with others in the development process enhances skills in teamwork, project management, and code integration.

## Passion for Gaming

Developing a game provides a learning experience that allows one to dive deep into the intricate workings of other developers games. It exposes me to various genres, mechanics, and storytelling methods. The sense of accomplishment from seeing a project evolve from concept to a playable game is immensely rewarding. 

Games also have a vibrant community of developers, artists, and enthusiasts so engaging with this community through forums, social media, or game jams not only fosters networking skills but also provides opportunities for learning from others, receiving feedback, and sharing experiences. Being part of the game development landscape will allow me to contribute to the gaming community, whether through sharing resources, tutorials, or creating content, it's a chance to give back and inspire others who share the same passion.

Developing a game as a side project will serve as a gateway to improving my technical skills, exploring my creativity, and nurturing my passion for gaming. It's a challenging yet rewarding journey that not only enhances my expertise but also fuels my love for storytelling, game creation, and collaborative engagement within the gaming community. 

All in all, let's get to it!
