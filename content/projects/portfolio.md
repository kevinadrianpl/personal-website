This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my resume and my devlog.

This is a static site using a theme called '[Risotto](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto)', a minimalist, responsive hugo theme inspired by terminal ricing aesthetics. It is hosted through Github Pages and Netlify, and can be accessed at https://kevinadrian.dev/
