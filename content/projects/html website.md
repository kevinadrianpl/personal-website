This is a simple 4-page website made as an example for a tattoo parlour that can be used as a template for basically any website. This was done as practice and contains basic code and images. The code for this project is freely available for use by anyone. Although it is very basic, it was one of my first HTML websites done to practice <font color="red">HTML, CSS and a bit of Tailwind</font>.

The template is available on [Github](https://github.com/kevinadrianpl/html-website).
