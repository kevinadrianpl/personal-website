A small and very basic static website built with Next.js, MDX, and Tailwind CSS.

The main purpose of the website is to host my own written tutorials for the in-game server to help new players. It also lists the global voting websites that players use for in-game rewards which helps the server reach more players. The server at its peak reached number 1 in South Africa, top 200 Towny servers in the world, and top 1000 servers in general. 

This is a basic project but serves the community when necessary.
