A small and very basic static website [template](https://github.com/alexcarpenter/nextjs-mdx-blog-theme) built with Next.js, MDX, and Tailwind CSS.

The main purpose of the website is to host my own written tutorials for the in-game server to help new players. It also lists the voting websites that players use for in-game rewards which also helps the server reach more players. At its peak, it has reached number 1 in South Africa, top 300 Towny servers in the world, and top 1000 servers in general. 

This is a basic project but very helpful to those that use the game server.
