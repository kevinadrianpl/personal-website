This is a website that I designed for a small/medium steel fabrication company and I currently maintain the website including security and changing/adding content to the website when requested by the company on a contract basis, done remotely. 

This is the website, [All Steel Production](https://www.aspkzn.co.za/). 
Currently it is built with Wordpress but I am in the process of a complete overhaul of this for security reasons.
