I own, maintain and secure a small Minecraft server that operates under the name <font color="red">Dxrery Networks</font> and is a Towny server hosted in South Africa with custom mod-like features and free time-based ranks in-game. 

The features of the game server contain custom jobs, a questing system, a battlepass, player-based and server shops, a claiming system based on creating a town and a community within that town, and much more. It currently runs [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads/paper) which is a fork of Spigot, designed to greatly improve performance and offer more advanced features and API. 

Many of the Java based plugins that run on the server are open source while many others are premium-paid plugins from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/). A few of these plugins I have coded myself in Java and are only available on this server, *for now*. 

This server was started in 2019 and has been online ever since, with an average daily user rate of 10 to 15 players, with the peak going up to over 50 players. 

This project is on-going indefinitely and most likely will not shut down any time soon since it is a used on a regular basis by South African players. As there are not many other South African based servers available. This helps the community with lower bandwidth that still want to play online at no cost to them.

<p>If you are interested, it can be connected to via the IP <font color="red">play.dxrery.cyou</font>.<p>
I have a community [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ubx7Tvu) server for it if there are any questions.
