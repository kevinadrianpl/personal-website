## Who am I?

I'm Kevin from South Africa and I make things on the internet and occasionally off of it. 
I'm an experienced System Administrator and cybersecurity professional and I have a passion for all things security, learning more technical skills each day. 

I sometimes play video games, work on different technical projects to enhance my skills and I often travel in my spare time. 

I believe that deeply understanding the underlying systems you use (browsers, operating systems, the kernel, network layers, databases, HTTP, or whatever else that you may be running in your business, workplace or personal life) is essential if you want to do technically innovative work and to be able to solve real world problems. I live by this philosophy and try to spend my time gaining experience and knowledge in the tech field, an ever changing world requires dedication. 


## Why do I blog?

I mostly have this website for selfish reasons. I needed a way to keep track of development over time – whatever I am thinking about or working on such as different technical projects. Another reason is to sharpen my skills on documentation since the tech world revolves around it. 
I've learnt that writing can improve one's thought process through research and that documentation helps reinforce one's knowledge over time. 
Documentation is an important skill. 

So I chose to start this blog as an intellectual journal of sorts, to become more disciplined and grow to be a better security and IT professional. 

I research things I find interesting, then document my research with a public blog post, which I can easily find and refer to later when information about said topic is needed. Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting. 

This is my personal portfolio and I will be using it to 'store' a few of my accomplishments and for posting articles about my passion for the cybersecurity and tech world in general.
