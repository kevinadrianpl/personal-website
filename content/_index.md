<h1> Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kevin Adrian Pillay</h1>

A techie originally from South Africa now making waves in The Netherlands.

I'm an experienced IT systems administrator and cybersecurity enthusiast with a history of working in multiple industries in various roles such as IT management, server management, system administration, and information security. 

I work on small non-commercial projects and firmly believe in the driving force of the open-source movement, every day is a chance to dive deeper into the vast sea of IT.
