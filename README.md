# Personal Website

This is my personal blog/portfolio website.

This is a static site using a Huge theme called '[Risotto](https://github.com/joeroe/risotto)', a minimalist, responsive hugo theme inspired by terminal ricing aesthetics. It is hosted through Github Pages and Netlify, and can be accessed at https://kevinadrian.dev/
